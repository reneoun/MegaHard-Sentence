# AI Interaction Report

**Date:** 12/28/2025
**Time:** 5:30:00 PM  
**Topic:** Editor Architecture Exploration and Decisions

## Summary

Explored different editor architectures for the MegaHard-Sentence text editor project. Started with separated textarea/preview approach, experimented with selection highlighting across markdown-to-HTML conversion, then tried unified WYSIWYG approach, and ultimately returned to the original clean architecture based on user preference for simplicity.

## Details

1. **Initial Setup**: Removed `marked` dependency and created custom markdown parser
2. **Selection Challenge**: Attempted to solve selection highlighting between textarea and preview pane using global state and DOM traversal
3. **WYSIWYG Experiment**: Built unified contenteditable editor with markdown shortcuts (Cmd+B, Cmd+I, Cmd+`) and auto-formatting
4. **Architecture Decision**: User concluded separated editor/preview is better than unified approach
5. **Code Cleanup**: Removed custom parsers and WYSIWYG implementation, restored original clean main.ts
6. **Project Configuration**: Created CLAUDE.md system prompt defining simple AI report approach

## Files Modified

- `package.json` (removed marked dependency, then restored original)
- `src/markdown-parser.ts` (created then removed)
- `src/wysiwyg-editor.ts` (created then removed) 
- `src/main.ts` (heavily modified with selection highlighting, WYSIWYG integration, then restored to original)
- `index.html` (switched between textarea/preview and contenteditable, restored to original)
- `CLAUDE.md` (created project configuration)
- `AI-Reports/` directory (created)

## Commands Executed

- `mkdir -p AI-Reports`
- `rm src/markdown-parser.ts src/wysiwyg-editor.ts`
- Various file reads and edits

## Key Learnings

- Selection mapping between markdown source and rendered HTML is complex
- Unified WYSIWYG editors require careful cursor position management
- Sometimes simpler architectures are preferable for maintainability
- User testing and feedback is crucial for architecture decisions

## Current State

Project is back to original clean architecture:
- Simple textarea for editing
- Separate preview div (currently unused)
- Multi-page navigation with Cmd+Enter
- Page deletion with Backspace on empty pages
- Arrow key navigation between pages
